# frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project 6: Jasmine JavaScript testing

## Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

### Steps taken to complete the project

1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Write a new test suite named "The menu".
4. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
5. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
6. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
7. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.

### How to run the app
Download the repository to your computer and open index.html in your browser. The Jasmine Test Suites will automatically run after opening index.html, afterwhich you can review the results at the bottom of the application page.
